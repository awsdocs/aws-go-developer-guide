   :description: Manage IAM access keys using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, IAM access keys


This Go example shows you how to create, modify, view, or rotate |IAM| access keys. You can download complete versions of these example files from the :doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <iam>` repository on GitHub.

.. _iam-access-keys-scenario:

Scenario
========

Users need their own access keys to make programmatic calls to the |sdk-go|. To fill this need, you can create, modify, view, or rotate access keys (access key IDs and secret access keys) for |IAM| users. By default, when you create an access key its status is Active, which means the user can use the access key for API calls.

In this example, you use a series of Go routines to manage access keys in |IAM|. The routines use the |sdk-go| IAM client methods that follow:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`CreateAccessKey <service/iam/#IAM.CreateAccessKey>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ListAccessKeys <service/iam/#IAM.ListAccessKeys>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetAccessKeyLastUsed <service/iam/#IAM.GetAccessKeyLastUsed>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`UpdateAccessKey <service/iam/#IAM.UpdateAccessKey>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteAccessKey <service/iam/#IAM.DeleteAccessKey>`

.. _iam-access-keys-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with |IAM| access keys. To learn more, see :iam-ug:`Managing Access Keys for IAM Users <id_credentials_access-keys>` in the |IAM-ug|.

.. _iam-example-create-access-key:

Create a New IAM Access Key
===========================

This code creates a new |IAM| access key for the |IAM| user named IAM_USER_NAME.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_createaccesskey.go`. You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_createaccesskey.go
   :lines: 15-23

Set up the session.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_createaccesskey.go
   :lines: 27,30-35

Call ``CreateAccessKey`` and print the results.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_createaccesskey.go
   :lines: 37-47

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/go/example_code/iam/iam_createaccesskey.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _iam-example-list-access-keys:

List a User's Access Keys
=========================

In this example, you get a list of the access keys for a user and print the list to the console.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_listaccesskeys.go`. You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_listaccesskeys.go
   :lines: 15-23

Set up a new |IAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_listaccesskeys.go
   :lines: 27,30-35

Call ``ListAccessKeys`` and print the results.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_listaccesskeys.go
   :lines: 37-48

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/go/example_code/iam/iam_listaccesskeys.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _iam_example_last_use:

Get the Last Use for an Access Key
==================================

In this example, you find out when an access key was last used.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_accesskeylastused.go`. You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_accesskeylastused.go
   :lines: 15-23

Set up a new |IAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_accesskeylastused.go
   :lines: 27,30-35

Call ``GetAccessKeyLastUsed``, passing in the access key ID, and print the results.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_accesskeylastused.go
   :lines: 37-48

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/go/example_code/iam/iam_accesskeylastused.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _iam_example_update-access-key:

Update Access Key Status
========================

.. There's nothing in the code that's about deleting a user--is this correct?

In this example, you delete an |IAM| user.

Create a new Go file with the name :file:`iam_updateaccesskey.go`. You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_updateaccesskey.go
   :lines: 15-23

Set up a new |IAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_updateaccesskey.go
   :lines: 27,30-35

Call ``UpdateAccessKey``, passing in the access key ID, status (making it active in this case), and user name.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_updateaccesskey.go
   :lines: 37-49

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/go/example_code/iam/iam_updateaccesskey.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _iam-example-delete-access-key:

Delete an Access Key
====================

In this example, you delete an access key.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_deleteaccesskey.go`. You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_deleteaccesskey.go
   :lines: 15-23

Set up a new |IAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_deleteaccesskey.go
   :lines: 27,30-35

Call ``DeleteAccessKey``, passing in the access key ID and user name.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_deleteaccesskey.go
   :lines: 37-48

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/go/example_code/iam/iam_deleteaccesskey.go>`_
on GitHub.
