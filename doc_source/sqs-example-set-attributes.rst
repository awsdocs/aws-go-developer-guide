Setting Attributes on an |SQS| Queue
####################################

.. meta::
   :description: Set attributes on an Amazon SQS queue using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, SQS, create queue

This Go example shows you how to set attributes on an existing |SQS| queue.

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <sqs>` repository on GitHub.

.. _sqs-attributes-scenario:

Scenario
========

This example updates an existing |SQS| queue to use long polling.

Long polling reduces the number of empty responses by allowing |SQS|
to wait a specified time for a message to become available in the queue before sending a response.
Also, long polling eliminates false empty responses by querying all of the servers instead of a
sampling of servers. To enable long polling, you must specify a non-zero wait time for received
messages. You can do this by setting the `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds` parameter of a queue or by
setting the `WaitTimeSeconds` parameter on a message when it is received.

The code uses these methods of the |SQS| client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetQueueUrl <service/sqs/#SQS.GetQueueUrl>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`SetQueueAttributes <service/sqs/#SQS.SetQueueAttributes>`

If you are unfamiliar with using |SQS| long polling, you should read
:sqs-dg:`Long Polling <sqs-long-polling>` in the |SQS-dg| before proceeding.

.. _sqs-attributes-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with using |SQS| long polling. To learn more,
  see :sqs-dg:`Long Polling <sqs-long-polling>` in the |SQS-dg|.

Set Attributes on Queue
=======================

Create a new Go file named :file:`sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go
   :lines: 15-27

Get the queue name and timeout passed in by the user.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go
   :lines: 33-43

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go
   :lines: 47-52

Get the queue. You need to convert the queue name into a URL. You can use the ``GetQueueUrl``
API call to retrieve the URL. This is needed for setting attributes on the queue. Print
any errors.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go
   :lines: 57-65

Update the queue to enable long polling.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go
   :lines: 68-79

The example uses this utility function.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go
   :lines: 81-84
