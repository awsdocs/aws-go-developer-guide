############################
Listing all |DDBlong| Tables
############################

.. meta::
   :description: List your DynamoDB tables using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, DynamoDB

The following example uses the |DDB| |nbsp| 
:sdk-go-api-deep:`ListTables <service/dynamodb/#DynamoDB.ListTables>` operation
to list all of the tables in your default region.

Create the file *DynamoDBListTables.go*.
Add the following statements to import the Go and |sdk-go| packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.list_tables.imports.txt
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load
credentials from the shared credentials file *~/.aws/credentials*
and region from the shared configuration file *~/.aws/config*
and create a new |DDB| service client.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.list_tables.session.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Call **ListTables**.
If an error occurs, print the error and exit.
If no error occurs, loop through the tabless, printing the name of each table.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.list_tables.call.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
