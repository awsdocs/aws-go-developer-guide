Creating an |DDBlong| Table Item
################################

.. meta::
   :description: Create a DynamoDB table item using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, DynamoDB

The following example uses the |DDB| |nbsp| 
:sdk-go-api-deep:`PutItem <service/dynamodb/#DynamoDB.PutItem>` operation
to create the table item with the :code:`year` **2015** and
:code:`title`  **The Big New Movie** in the :code:`Movies` table in 
your default region.

Create the file *DynamoDBCreateItem.go*.
Add the following statements to import the Go and |sdk-go| packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.create_item.imports.txt
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Create the data structure we use to containing the information about the
table item.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.create_item.struct.txt
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load
credentials from the shared credentials file *~/.aws/credentials*
and region from the shared configuration file *~/.aws/config*,
and create the |DDB| client.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.create_item.session.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Create a struct with the movie data and marshall that data into a
map of **AttributeValue** objects.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.create_item.assign_struct.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Create the input for **PutItem** and call it.
If an error occurs, print the error and exit.
If no error occurs, print an message that the item was added to the table.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.create_item.call.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
