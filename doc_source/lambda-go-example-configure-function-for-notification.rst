Configuring a |LAM| Function to Receive Notifications

        Configure AWS Lambda functions using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, Lambda

The following example configures the |LAM| function :code:`functionName`
to accept notifications from the resource with the ARN :code:`sourceArn`.

The first step is to create the session and |LAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-go-sdk-lambda-example-configure-function-for-notification.go
   :lines: 29-32, 34
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Next, we create the structure for the input argument to the :code:`AddPermission` function.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-go-sdk-lambda-example-configure-function-for-notification.go
   :lines: 36-42
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Finally, we call :code:`AddPermission` and display a message with the result of the call.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-go-sdk-lambda-example-configure-function-for-notification.go
   :lines: 44-51
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
