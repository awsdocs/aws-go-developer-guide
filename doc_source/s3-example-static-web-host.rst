Using an |S3| Bucket as a Static Web Host
#########################################

.. meta::
   :description: Set up an Amazon S3 bucket as a static web host using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, S3 static web host


This |sdk-go| example shows you how to configure an |S3| bucket to act as a static web host. You can download
complete versions of these example files from the :doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <s3>` repository on GitHub.

.. _s3-website-scenario:

Scenario
========

In this example, you use a series of Go routines to configure any of your
buckets to act as a static web host. The routines use the |sdk-go| to configure a selected |S3|
bucket using these methods of the |S3| client class:

* GetBucketWebsite
* PutBucketWebsite
* DeleteBucketWebsite

For more information about using an |S3| bucket as a static web host, see
:s3-dg:`Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3 <WebsiteHosting>` in the |S3-dg|.

.. _s3-website-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>`, and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with hosting static websites on |S3|. To learn more,
  see :s3-dg:`Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3 <WebsiteHosting>` in the |S3-dg|.

.. _s3-example-retrieve-config:

Retrieve a Bucket's Website Configuration
=========================================

Create a new Go file named :file:`s3_get_bucket_website.go`. You must import the
relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 17-24
   :language: go

This routine requires you to pass in an argument containing the name of the bucket for which
you want to get website configuration.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 31-35
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials from the shared credentials file,
~/.aws/credentials, and create a new S3 service client.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 39-44
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Call :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetBucketWebsite <service/s3/#S3.GetBucketWebsite>` to get the bucket configuration.
You should check for the ``NoSuchWebsiteConfiguration`` error code, which tells you that the bucket doesn't
have a website configured.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 47-57
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Print the bucket's website configuration.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 60-61
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

.. _s3-example-set-bucket-website:

Set a Bucket's Website Configuration
====================================

Create a Go file named :file:`s3_set_bucket_website.go` and add the code below. The |S3|
:sdk-go-api-deep:`PutBucketWebsite <service/s3/#S3.PutBucketWebsite>` operation
sets the website configuration on a bucket, replacing any existing configuration.

Create a new Go file named :file:`s3_create_bucket.go`. You must import the relevant Go and
|sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 17-24
   :language: go

This routine requires you to pass in an argument containing the name of the bucket and the index suffix page.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 35-42
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load configuration, credentials,
and region information from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials, and create a new S3 service client.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 46-51
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Create the parameters to be passed in to :sdk-go-api-deep:`PutBucketWebsite <service/s3/#S3.PutBucketWebsite>`,
including the bucket name and index document details. If the user passed in an error page
when calling the routine, also add that to the parameters.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 54-68
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Call ``PutBucketWebsite``, passing in the parameters you just defined. If an error occurs,
print the errordetails and exit the routine.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 72-78
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

.. _s3-example-delete-website:

Delete Website Configuration on a Bucket
========================================

Create a Go file named :file:`s3_delete_bucket_website.go`.
Import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_delete_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 17-24
   :language: go

This routine requires you to pass in the name of the bucket for which you want to delete the
website configuration.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_delete_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 36-41
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load
configuration, credentials, and region information from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials, and
create a new S3 service client.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_delete_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 45-50
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Call ``DeleteBucketWebsite`` and pass in the name of the bucket to complete the action.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_delete_bucket_website.go
   :lines: 55-63
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4
