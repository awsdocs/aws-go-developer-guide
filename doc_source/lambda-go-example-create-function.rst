#########################
Creating a |LAM| Function
#########################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Create AWS Lambda functions using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, Lambda

The following example creates the |LAM| function :code:`functionName`
in the :code:`us-west-2` region using the following values:

* Role ARN: :code:`resourceArn`.
  In most cases, you need to attach only the
  :code:`AWSLambdaExecute` managed policy
  to the policy for this role.

* Function entry point: :code:`handler`

* Runtime: :code:`runtime`

* Zip file: :code:`zipFileName` + :code:`.zip`

* Bucket: :code:`bucketName`

* Key: :code:`zipFileName`

The first step is to import the packages we use in the example.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-go-sdk-lambda-example-create-function.go
   :lines: 17-26
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Next, create the session and |LAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-go-sdk-lambda-example-create-function.go
   :lines: 30-33, 35
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Next, create the structures for the input argument to the :code:`CreateFunction` function.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-go-sdk-lambda-example-create-function.go
   :lines: 44-57
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Finally, call :code:`CreateFunction` and display a message with the result of the call.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-go-sdk-lambda-example-create-function.go
   :lines: 59-64
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go
