   :description: Manage visibility timeout with Amazon SQS queues using this AWS SDK for Go code exammple.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, creating SQS queues


This |sdk-go| example shows you how to:

* Change visibility timeout with |SQS| queues

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <sqs>` repository on GitHub.

.. _sqs-visibility-scenario:

Scenario
========

This example manages visibility timeout with |SQS| queues. It uses these methods of the
|SQS| client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`CreateQueue <service/sqs/#SQS.CreateQueue>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ListQueues <service/sqs/#SQS.ListQueues>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetQueueUrl <service/sqs/#SQS.GetQueueUrl>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteQueue <service/sqs/#SQS.DeleteQueue>`


.. _sqs-visibility-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with using |SQS| visibility timeout. To learn more,
  see :sqs-dg:`Visibility Timeout <sqs-visibility-timeout>` in the |SQS-dg|.


.. _sqs-example-visibility-timeout:

Change the Visibility Timeout
=============================

Create a new Go file named :file:`sqs_changingvisibility.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_changingvisibility.go
   :lines: 15-23

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_changingvisibility.go
   :lines: 27, 30-35

Get a message from the queue. Call ``ReceiveMessage``. Pass in the URL of the queue
to return details of the next message in the queue. Print any errors, or a
message if no message was received.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_changingvisibility.go
   :lines: 38-60

If a message was returned, use its receipt handle to set the timeout to 30 seconds.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_changingvisibility.go
   :lines: 63-76
