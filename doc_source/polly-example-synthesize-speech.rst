        Synthesizing speech using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, Amazon Polly

This example uses the
:sdk-go-api-deep:`SynthesizeSpeech <service/polly/#Polly.SynthesizeSpeech>` operation
to get the text from a file and produce an MP3 file containing the synthesized speech.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *pollySynthesizeSpeech.go*.
Import the packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/pollySynthesizeSpeech.go
   :lines: 17-27
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Get the name of the text file from the command line.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/pollySynthesizeSpeech.go
   :lines: 30-34, 36
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Open the text file and read the contents as a string.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/pollySynthesizeSpeech.go
   :lines: 39, 47
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file :file:`~/.aws/credentials`,
load your configuration from the shared configuration file :file:`~/.aws/config`,
and create an Amazon Polly client.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/pollySynthesizeSpeech.go
   :lines: 51-54, 56
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Create the input for and call :code:`SynthesizeSpeech`.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/pollySynthesizeSpeech.go
   :lines: 59-61
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Save the resulting synthesized speech as an MP3 file.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/pollySynthesizeSpeech.go
   :lines: 69-73, 80
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

.. note:: The resulting MP3 file is in the MPEG-2 format.
