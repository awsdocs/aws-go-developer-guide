Using |SQS| Queues
##################

.. meta::
   :description: Learn to work with Amazon SQS queues using this AWS SDK for Go.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, SQS, create queue


These |sdk-go| examples show you how to:

*  List |SQS| queues
*  Create |SQS| queues
*  Get |SQS| queue URLs
*  Delete |SQS| queues

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <sqs>` repository on GitHub.

.. _sqs-create-scenario:

Scenario
========

These examples demonstrate how to work with |SQS| queues.

The code uses these methods of the |SQS| client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`CreateQueue <service/sqs/#SQS.CreateQueue>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ListQueues <service/sqs/#SQS.ListQueues>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetQueueUrl <service/sqs/#SQS.GetQueueUrl>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteQueue <service/sqs/#SQS.DeleteQueue>`

.. _sqs-create-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with using |SQS|. To learn more, see :sqs-dg:`How Queues Work <sqs-how-it-works>` in the |SQS-dg|.


.. _sqs-example-list-queues:

List Queues
===========

Create a new Go file named :file:`sqs_listqueues.go`. You must import the relevant Go and
|sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_listqueues.go
   :lines: 15-22

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_listqueues.go
   :lines: 26,29-34

Call ``ListQueues`` passing in ``nil`` to return all queues. Print any errors or a success
message and loop through the queue URLs to print them.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_listqueues.go
   :lines: 37-52

Create Queues
=============

Create a new Go file named :file:`sqs_createqueues.go`. You must import the relevant Go and
|sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_createqueues.go
   :lines: 15-23

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_createqueues.go
   :lines: 27,30-35

Call ``CreateQueue`` passing in the new queue name and queue attributes. Print any errors
or a success message.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_createqueues.go
   :lines: 37-50


Get a Queue URL
===============

Create a new Go file named :file:`sqs_getqueueurl.go`. You must import the relevant Go and
|sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_getqueueurl.go
   :lines: 15-23

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_getqueueurl.go
   :lines: 27,30-35

Call ``GetQueueUrl`` passing in the queue name. Print any errors
or a success message.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_getqueueurl.go
   :lines: 37-47

Delete a Queue
==============

Create a new Go file named :file:`sqs_deletequeue.go`. You must import the relevant Go and
|sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_deletequeue.go
   :lines: 15-23

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_deletequeue.go
   :lines: 27,30-35

Call ``DeleteQueue`` passing in the queue name. Print any errors
or a success message.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_deletequeue.go
   :lines: 37-47
