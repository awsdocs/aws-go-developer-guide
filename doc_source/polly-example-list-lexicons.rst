        Get the list of pronunciation lexicons stored in an AWS Region using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, Amazon Polly

This example uses the
:sdk-go-api-deep:`ListLexicons <service/polly/#Polly.ListLexicons>` operation
to get the list of lexicons in the :code:`us-west-2` region.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *pollyListLexicons.go*.
Import the packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/pollyListLexicons.go
   :lines: 17-23
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file :file:`~/.aws/credentials`,
load your configuration from the shared configuration file :file:`~/.aws/config`,
and create an Amazon Polly client.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/pollyListLexicons.go
   :lines: 28-31, 33
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Call :code:`ListLexicons` and display the name, alphabet, and language code of each lexicon.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/pollyListLexicons.go
   :lines: 35, 41-47
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
