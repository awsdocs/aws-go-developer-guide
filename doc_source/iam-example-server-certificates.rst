   :description: Learn to manage |IAM| server certificates using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, IAM server certificates

This Go example shows you how to carry out basic tasks for managing server certificate HTTPS connections with the |sdk-go|.

You can download complete versions of these example files from the :doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <s3>` repository on GitHub.

.. _iam-certificates-scenario:

Scenario
========

To enable HTTPS connections to your website or application on AWS, you need an SSL/TLS server certificate. To use a certificate that you obtained from an external provider with your website or application on AWS, you must upload the certificate to |IAM| or import it into AWS Certificate Manager.

In this example, you use a series of Go routines to manage policies in |IAM|. The routines use the |sdk-go| |IAM| client methods that follow:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ListServerCertificates <service/iam/#IAM.ListServerCertificates>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetServerCertificate <service/iam/#IAM.GetServerCertificate>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`UpdateServerCertificate <service/iam/#IAM.UpdateServerCertificate>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteServerCertificate <service/iam/#IAM.DeleteServerCertificate>`

.. _iam-certificates-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with server certificates. To learn more, see :iam-ug:`Working with Server Certificates <id_credentials_server-certs>` in the |IAM-ug|.

.. _iam-example-list-certificates:

List Your Server Certificates
=============================

This code lists your certificates.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_listservercerts.go`. You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: iam/iam_listservercerts.go
   :lines: 26,29-34

Call ``ListServerCertificates`` and print the details.

.. literalinclude:: iam/iam_listservercerts.go
   :lines: 36-49


.. _iam-example-get-certificate:

Get a Server Certificate
========================

In this example, you retrieve an existing server certificate.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_getservercert.go`. You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: iam/iam_getservercert.go
   :lines: 15-23

Set up a new IAM client.

.. literalinclude:: iam/iam_getservercert.go
   :lines: 27,30-35

Call ``GetServerCertificate``, passing the name of the certificate, and print the results.

.. literalinclude:: iam/iam_getservercert.go
   :lines: 37-46

.. _iam-example-update-certificate:

Update a Server Certificate
===========================

In this example, you update an existing server certificate.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_updateservercert.go`. You call the ``UpdateServerCertificate`` method of the |IAM| service object to change the name of the certificate.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: iam/iam_updateservercert.go
   :lines: 15-23

Set up a new |IAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: iam/iam_updateservercert.go
   :lines: 27,30-35

Update the certificate name.

.. literalinclude:: iam/iam_updateservercert.go
   :lines: 37-47

.. _iam_example_delete_server_certificate:

Delete a Server Certificate
===========================

In this example, you delete an existing server certificate.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_deleteservercert.go`. You call the ``DeleteServerCertificate`` method of the |IAM| service object to change the name of the certificate.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: iam/iam_deleteservercert.go
   :lines: 15-23

Set up a new |IAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: iam/iam_deleteservercert.go
   :lines: 27,30-35

Call the method to delete the certificate, specifying the name of certificate.

.. literalinclude:: iam/iam_deleteservercert.go
   :lines: 37-46
