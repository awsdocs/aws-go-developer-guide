   :description: Create a DynamoDB table using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, DynamoDB

The following example uses the |DDB| |nbsp| 
:sdk-go-api-deep:`CreateTable <service/dynamodb/#DynamoDB.CreateTable>` operation
to create the table **Music** your default region.

Create the file *DynamoDBCreateTable.go*.
Add the following statements to import the Go and |sdk-go| packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.create_table.imports.txt
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load
credentials from the shared credentials file *~/.aws/credentials*
and region from the shared configuration file *~/.aws/config*,
and create the |DDB| client.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.create_table.session.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Call **CreateTable**.
If an error occurs, print the error and exit.
If no error occurs, print an message that the table was created.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.create_table.call.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
