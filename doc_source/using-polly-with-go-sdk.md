# Amazon Polly Examples Using the AWS SDK for Go<a name="using-polly-with-go-sdk"></a>

Amazon Polly is a cloud service that converts text into lifelike speech\. The AWS SDK for Go examples can integrate Amazon Polly into your applications\. The examples assume you have already set up and configured the SDK \(that is, youâ€™ve imported all required packages and set your credentials and region\)\. For more information, see [Getting Started with the AWS SDK for Go](setting-up.md) and [Configuring the AWS SDK for Go](configuring-sdk.md)\.

You can download complete versions of these example files from the [aws\-doc\-sdk\-examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/go/example_code/polly) repository on GitHub\.
