Using Elastic IP Addresses in |EC2|
###################################

.. meta::
   :description: Allocate Elastic IP addresses in Amazon EC2 using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, Elastic IP addresses


These Go examples show you how to:

* Describe |EC2| instance IP addresses
* Allocate addresses to |EC2| instances
* Release |EC2| instance IP addresses

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <ec2>` repository on GitHub.

.. _ec-allocate-address-scenario:

Scenario
========

An Elastic IP address is a static IP address designed for dynamic cloud computing that is associated with
your AWS account. It is a public IP address, reachable from
the Internet. If your instance doesn't have a public IP address, you can associate an Elastic IP
address with the instance to enable communication with the Internet.

In this example, you use a series of Go routines to perform several |EC2| operations involving
Elastic IP addresses. The routines use the |sdk-go| to manage Elastic IP addresses by using these
methods of the |EC2| client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DescribeAddresses <service/ec2/#EC2.DescribeAddresses>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`AllocateAddress <service/ec2/#EC2.AllocateAddress>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`AssociateAddress <service/ec2/#EC2.AssociateAddress>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ReleaseAddress <service/ec2/#EC2.ReleaseAddress>`

.. _ec-allocate-address-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with Elastic IP addresses in |EC2|. To learn more, see
  :ec2-ug:`Elastic IP Addresses <elastic-ip-addresses-eip>` in the |EC2-ug| or
  :ec2-ug-win:`Elastic IP Addresses <elastic-ip-addresses-eip>` in the |EC2-ug-win|.

.. _ec2-example-describe:

Describe Instance IP Addresses
==============================

Create a new Go file named :file:`ec2_describe_addresses.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_describe_addresses.go
   :lines: 15-24

Get the Address Descriptions
----------------------------

This routine prints out the Elastic IP Addresses for the account's VPC. Initialize a session that the
SDK will use to load credentials from the shared credentials file,
~/.aws/credentials, and create a new EC2 service client.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_describe_addresses.go
   :lines: 30, 33-38

Make the API request to EC2 filtering for the addresses in the account's VPC.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_describe_addresses.go
   :lines: 42-63

The ``fmtAddress`` and ``exitErrorf`` functions are utility functions used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_describe_addresses.go
   :lines: 65-

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/go/ec2/ec2_describe_addresses.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _ec2-example-allocate:

Allocate Addresses to Instances
===============================

Create a new Go file named :file:`ec2_allocate_address.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_allocate_address.go
   :lines: 15-25

This routine attempts to allocate a VPC Elastic IP address for the current region. The IP address
requires and will be associated with the instance ID that is passed in.


.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_allocate_address.go
   :lines: 32-37

You will need to initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials, and create a new |EC2| service client.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_allocate_address.go
   :lines: 41-46

Call :sdk-go-api-deep:`AllocateAddress <service/ec2/#EC2.AllocateAddress>`, passing in
"vpc" as the Domain value.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_allocate_address.go
   :lines: 49-54

Call :sdk-go-api-deep:`AssociateAddress <service/ec2/#EC2.AssociateAddress>` to associate the new Elastic IP
address with an existing |EC2| instance, and print out the results.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_allocate_address.go
   :lines: 57-68

This example also uses the ``exitErrorf`` utility function.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_allocate_address.go
   :lines: 70-73

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/go/ec2/ec2_allocate_address.go>`_
on GitHub.           

.. _ec2-example-release-instance-addresses:           

Release Instance IP Addresses
=============================

This routine releases an Elastic IP address allocation ID. If the address is associated
with an |EC2| instance, the association is removed.

Create a new Go file named :file:`ec2_release_address.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_release_address.go
   :lines: 15-26

The routine requires that the user pass in the allocation ID of the Elastic IP address.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_release_address.go
   :lines: 33-38

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials, and create a new EC2 service client.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_release_address.go
   :lines: 42-47

Attempt to release the Elastic IP address by using the allocation ID.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_release_address.go
   :lines: 50-62

This example uses the ``fmtAddress`` and ``exitErrorf`` utility functions.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/ec2_describe_addresses.go
   :lines: 65-

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/go/ec2/ec2_describe_addresses.go>`_
