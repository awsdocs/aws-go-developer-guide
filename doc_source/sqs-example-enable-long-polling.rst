#####################################
Enabling Long Polling in |SQS| Queues
#####################################

.. meta::
   :description: Enable long polling with Amazon SQS queues using this AWS SDK code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, SQS, create queue


These |sdk-go| examples show you how to:

* Enable long polling when you create an |SQS| queue
* Enable long polling on an existing |SQS| queue
* Enable long polling when a message is received

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <sqs>` repository on GitHub.

.. _sqs-long-polling-scenario:

Scenario
========

Long polling reduces the number of empty responses by allowing |SQS|
to wait a specified time for a message to become available in the queue before sending a response.
Also, long polling eliminates false empty responses by querying all of the servers instead of a
sampling of servers. To enable long polling, you must specify a non-zero wait time for received
messages. You can do this by setting the ``ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds`` parameter of a queue
or by
setting the ``WaitTimeSeconds`` parameter on a message when it is received.

The code uses these methods of the |SQS| client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`SetQueueAttributes <service/sqs/#SQS.SetQueueAttributes>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ReceiveMessage <service/sqs/#SQS.ReceiveMessage>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`CreateQueue <service/sqs/#SQS.CreateQueue>`

.. _sqs-long-polling-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with |SQS| polling. To learn more, see
  :sqs-dg:`Long Polling <sqs-long-polling>` in the |SQS-dg|.


.. _sqs-example-create-queue-long-pollling:

Enable Long Polling When Creating a Queue
=========================================

This example creates a queue with long polling enabled. If the queue already exists,
no error is returned.

Create a new Go file named :file:`sqs_longpolling_create_queue.go`. You must import the
relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_create_queue.go
   :lines: 15-26

Get the queue name passed in by the user.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_create_queue.go
   :lines: 33-43

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_create_queue.go
   :lines: 47-52

Create the queue with long polling enabled. Print any errors or a success message.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_create_queue.go
   :lines: 55-67

The example uses this utility function.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_create_queue.go
   :lines: 69-72


Enable Long Polling on an Existing Queue
========================================

Create a new Go file named :file:`sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go
   :lines: 15-27

This example takes two flags, the -n flag is the queue name, and the -t flag contains the
timeout value.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go
   :lines: 33-43

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go
   :lines: 47-52

You need to convert the queue name into a URL.
Make the ``GetQueueUrl`` API call to retrieve the URL. This is needed for setting attributes
on the queue.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go
   :lines: 57-65

Update the queue to enable long polling with a call to ``SetQueueAttributes``, passing in the
queue URL. Print any errors or a success message.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_existing_queue.go
   :lines: 68-84

Enable Long Polling on Message Receipt
======================================

Create a new Go file named :file:`sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go
   :lines: 15-26

This example takes two flags, the -n flag is the queue name, and the -t flag contains the
timeout value.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go
   :lines: 32-42

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go
   :lines: 46-51

You need to convert the queue name into a URL.
Make the ``GetQueueUrl`` API call to retrieve the URL. This is needed for setting attributes
on the queue.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go
   :lines: 56-64

Receive a message from the queue with long polling enabled with a call to
``ReceiveMessage``, passing in the queue URL. Print any errors or a success message.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go
   :lines: 67-91
