##############################################################
Setting Default Server-Side Encryption for an Amazon S3 Bucket
##############################################################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Encrypt Amazon S3 bucket objects by default using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples

The following example uses the
:sdk-go-api-deep:`PutBucketEncryption <service/s3/#S3.PutBucketEncryption>`
method to enable KMS server-side encryption on any objects added to
:code:`myBucket`.

The only exception is if the user configures their request to explicitly
use server-side encryption. In that case, the specified encryption takes precedence.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *set_default_encryption.go*.

Import the required packages.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_set_default_encryption.go
   :lines: 17-24
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Get the KMS key from the command line,
where :code:`key` is a KMS key ID as created in the :doc:`kms-example-create-key` example,
and set the bucket name.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_set_default_encryption.go
   :lines: 27-33
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Create a session and |S3| client.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_set_default_encryption.go
   :lines: 38-42
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Create the input for and call :code:`PutBucketEncryption`, and display a success message.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_set_default_encryption.go
   :lines: 45-49, 51, 58
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
