Handling Errors in the |sdk-go|
###############################

.. meta::
   :description: Use the Error interface to handle errors from the |sdk-go| or AWS service.
   :keywords: errors, error handling, error interface

The |sdk-go| returns errors that satisfy the Go ``error``
interface type and the :sdk-go-api-deep:`Error <aws/awserr/#Error>` interface in the
``aws/awserr`` package. You can use the ``Error()`` method to get a formatted string of
the SDK error message without any special handling.

.. code:: go

    if err != nil {
        if awsErr, ok := err.(awserr.Error); ok {
            // process SDK error
        }
    }

Errors returned by the SDK are backed by a concrete type that will
satisfy the ``awserr.Error`` interface. The interface has the following
methods, which provide classification and information about the error.

-  ``Code`` returns the classification code by which related errors are
   grouped.
-  ``Message`` returns a description of the error.
-  ``OrigErr`` returns the original error of type ``error`` that is
   wrapped by the ``awserr.Error`` interface, such as a standard library
   error or a service error.

Handling Specific Service Error Codes
=====================================

.. meta::
   :description: Handle error codes returned by AWS services in the |sdk-go|.
   :keywords: errors, error handling, error interface

The following example demonstrates how to handle error codes that you encounter while using the
|sdk-go|. The example assumes you have already set up and configured the SDK (that
is, all required packages are imported and your credentials and region
are set). For more information, see :doc:`setting-up` and :doc:`configuring-sdk`.

This example highlights how you can use the `awserr.Error` type to perform logic based on specific error codes
returned by service API operations.

In this example the `S3` `GetObject` API operation is used to request the contents of an object in S3. The
example handles the `NoSuchBucket` and `NoSuchKey` error codes, printing custom messages to stderr. If any
other error is received, a generic message is printed.

Additional Error Information
============================

In addition to the ``awserr.Error`` interface, you might be able to use
other interfaces to get more information about an error.

Specific Error Interfaces
-------------------------

Other packages might provide their own error interfaces. For example,
the :sdk-go-api-deep:`service/s3/s3manager <service/s3/s3manager>` package
provides a :sdk-go-api-deep:`MultiUploadFailure <service/s3/s3manager/#MultiUploadFailure>`
interface to retrieve the upload ID. This is helpful when you must
manually clean up a failed multi-part upload.

.. code:: go

    output, err := s3manager.Upload(svc, input, opts)
    if err != nil {
        if multierr, ok := err.(MultiUploadFailure); ok {
            // Process error and its associated uploadID
            fmt.Println("Error:", multierr.Code(), multierr.Message(), multierr.UploadID())
        } else {
            // Process error generically
            fmt.Println("Error:", err.Error())
        }
    }

For more information, see the
:sdk-go-api-deep:`s3Manager.MultiUploadFailure <service/s3/s3manager/#MultiUploadFailure>`
interface in the |sdk-go-api|.
