###############################################
Using Regions and Availability Zones with |EC2|
###############################################

.. meta::
   :description: Work with regions and Availability Zones using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, EC2 availability zones and regions

These Go examples show you how to retrieve details about AWS Regions and Availability Zones.

An |EC2| security group acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or
more instances. You add rules to each security group to allow traffic to or from its
associated instances. You can modify the rules for a security group at any time; the
new rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security
group.

The code in this example uses the |sdk-go| to perform these tasks by using these
methods of the |EC2| client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DescribeSecurityGroups <service/ec2/#EC2.DescribeSecurityGroups>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress <service/ec2/#EC2.AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`CreateSecurityGroup <service/ec2/#EC2.CreateSecurityGroup>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DescribeVpcs <service/ec2/#EC2.DescribeVpcs>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteSecurityGroup <service/ec2/#EC2.DeleteSecurityGroup>`

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <ec2>` repository on GitHub.

.. _ec2-scenario-regions-and-azs:

Scenario
========

|EC2| is hosted in multiple locations worldwide. These locations are composed of AWS Regions and Availability
Zones. Each region is a separate geographic area with multiple, isolated locations known as Availability
Zones. |EC2| provides the ability to place instances and data in these multiple locations.

In this example, you use Go code to retrieve details about regions and Availability Zones. The code uses
the |sdk-go| tomanage instances by using the following methods of the |EC2| client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DescribeAvailabilityZones <service/ec2/#EC2.DescribeAvailabilityZones>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DescribeRegions <service/ec2/#EC2.DescribeRegions>`

.. _ec2-regions-and-azs-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with AWS Regions and Availability Zones. To learn more, see
  :ec2-ug:`Regions and Availability Zones <using-regions-availability-zones>` in the
  |ec2-ug| or :ec2-ug-win:`Regions and Availability Zones <resources>` in the |ec2-ug-win|.

List the Groups
===============

This example describes the security groups by IDs that are passed in to the routine. It takes
a space separated list of group IDs as input.

To get started, create a new Go file named :file:`regions_and_availability.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/regions_and_availability.go
   :lines: 15-22

In the ``main`` function, create a session
with credentials from the shared credentials file,
~/.aws/credentials,
and create a new EC2 client.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/regions_and_availability.go
   :lines: 26-33

Print out the list of regions that work with |EC2| that are returned by calling ``DescribeRegions``.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/regions_and_availability.go
   :lines: 36-40

Add a call that retrieves Availability Zones only for the region of the EC2 service object.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/regions_and_availability.go
   :lines: 45-52
