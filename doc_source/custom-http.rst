Creating a Custom HTTP Client
#############################

   :description: Create a custom HTTP client with the |sdk-go| to specify custom timeout values.
   :keywords: HTTP, timeout

The |sdk-go| uses a default HTTP client with default configuration values.
Although you can change some of these configuration values,
the default HTTP client and transport are not sufficiently configurable for customers
using the |sdk-go| in an environment with high throughput and low latency requirements.
This section describes how to create a custom HTTP client,
and use that client to create |sdk-go| calls.

To assist you in creating a custom HTTP client,
this section describes how to create a structure to encapsulate the custom settings,
create a function to create a custom HTTP client based on those settings,
and use that custom HTTP client to call an |sdk-go| service client.

Let's define what we want to customize.

Dialer.KeepAlive
================

This setting represents the keep-alive period for an active network connection.

Set to a negative value to disable keep-alives.

Set to **0** to enable keep-alives if supported by the protocol and operating system.

Network protocols or operating systems that do not support keep-alives ignore this field.
By default, TCP enables keep alive.

See https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dialer.KeepAlive

We'll call this ``ConnKeepAlive`` as **time.Duration**.

.. _timeout-struct-connect:

Dialer.Timeout
==============

This setting represents the maximum amount of time a dial to wait for a connection to be created.

Default is 30 seconds.

See https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dialer.Timeout

We'll call this ``Connect`` as **time.Duration**.

.. _timeout-struct-expect-continue:

Transport.ExpectContinueTimeout
===============================

This setting represents the maximum amount of time to wait for a server's first response headers
after fully writing the request headers,
if the request has an "Expect: 100-continue" header.
This time does not include the time to send the request header.
The HTTP client sends its payload after this timeout is exhausted.

Default 1 second.

Set to **0** for no timeout and send request payload without waiting.
One use case is when you run into issues with proxies or third party services that take a session
similar to the use of |S3| in the function shown later.

See https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Transport.ExpectContinueTimeout

We'll call this ``ExpectContinue`` as **time.Duration**.

.. _timeout-struct-idle-conn-timeout:

Transport.IdleConnTimeout
=========================

This setting represents the maximum amount of time to keep an idle network connection alive between HTTP requests.

Set to **0** for no limit.

See https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Transport.IdleConnTimeout

We'll call this ``IdleConn`` as **time.Duration**.

.. _timeout-struct-keep-alive:

.. _timeout-struct-max-idle-conns:

Transport.MaxIdleConns
======================

This setting represents the maximum number of idle (keep-alive) connections across all hosts.
One use case for increasing this value is when you are seeing many connections in a short period from the same clients

**0** means no limit.

See https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Transport.MaxIdleConns

We'll call this ``MaxAllIdleConns`` as **int**.

.. _timeout-struct-max-idle-conn-per-host:

Transport.MaxIdleConnsPerHost
=============================

This setting represents the maximum number of idle (keep-alive) connections to keep per-host.
One use case for increasing this value is when you are seeing many connections in a short period from the same clients

Default is two idle connections per host.

Set to **0** to use DefaultMaxIdleConnsPerHost (2).

See https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Transport.MaxIdleConnsPerHost

We'll call this ``MaxHostIdleConns`` as **int**.  

.. _timeout-struct-response-header-timeout:

Transport.ResponseHeaderTimeout
===============================

This setting represents the maximum amount of time to wait for a client to read the response header.

If the client isn't able to read the response's header within this duration,
the request fails with a timeout error.

Be careful setting this value when using long-running Lambda functions,
as the operation does not return any response headers until the Lambda function has finished or timed out.
However, you can still use this option with the **InvokeAsync** API operation.

Default is no timeout; wait forever.

See https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Transport.ResponseHeaderTimeout

We'll call this ``ResponseHeader`` as **time.Duration**.

.. _timeout-struct-tls-handshake-timeout:

Transport.TLSHandshakeTimeout
=============================

This setting represents the maximum amount of time waiting for a TLS handshake to be completed.

Default is 10 seconds.

Zero means no timeout.

See https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Transport.TLSHandshakeTimeout

We'll call this ``TLSHandshake`` as **time.Duration**.

.. _set_imports:

Create Import Statement
=======================

The complete example imports the following Go packages.

.. code-block:: go

    import (
        "bytes"
        "flag"
        "fmt"
        "net"
        "net/http"
        "os"
        "time"

        "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
        "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session"
        "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3"

        "golang.org/x/net/http2"
    )

.. _timeout-struct:

Creating a Timeout Struct
=========================

Let's create a struct to hold the timeout values we want to be able to set
on our HTTP client.

.. code-block:: go

    type HTTPClientSettings struct {
        Connect          time.Duration
        ConnKeepAlive    time.Duration
        ExpectContinue   time.Duration
        IdleConn         time.Duration
        MaxAllIdleConns  int
        MaxHostIdleConns int
        ResponseHeader   time.Duration
        TLSHandshake     time.Duration
    }

.. _timeout-func:

Creating a Function to Create a Custom HTTP Client
==================================================

Next let's create a function that takes a **ClientTimeout** struct
and creates a custom HTTP client based on those timeout values.

.. code-block:: go

    func NewHTTPClientWithTimeouts(httpSettings HTTPClientSettings) *http.Client {
        tr := &http.Transport{
            ResponseHeaderTimeout: httpSettings.ResponseHeader,
            Proxy:                 http.ProxyFromEnvironment,
            DialContext:           (&net.Dialer{
                KeepAlive: httpSettings.ConnKeepAlive,
                DualStack: true,
                Timeout:   httpSettings.Connect,
            }).DialContext,
            MaxIdleConns:          httpSettings.MaxAllIdleConns,
            IdleConnTimeout:       httpSettings.IdleConn,
            TLSHandshakeTimeout:   httpSettings.TLSHandshake,
            MaxIdleConnsPerHost:   httpSettings.MaxHostIdleConns,
            ExpectContinueTimeout: httpSettings.ExpectContinue,
        }

        // So client makes HTTP/2 requests
        http2.ConfigureTransport(tr)

        return &http.Client{
            Transport: tr,
        }
    }

.. _s3-client:

Using a Custom HTTP Client
==========================

Let's create a custom HTTP client and use it to 
create an |S3| client.

The following example creates an **http.Client** that is configured to have:

- a five second TCP connection timeout
- a five second TLS handshake timeout
- a five second wait for the HTTP response headers

.. code-block:: go

    sess := session.Must(session.NewSession(&aws.Config{
        Region: regionPtr,
        HTTPClient: NewHTTPClientWithSettings(HTTPClientSettings{
            Connect:          5 * time.Second,
            ExpectContinue:   1 * time.Second,
            IdleConn:         90 * time.Second,
            ConnKeepAlive:    30 * time.Second,
            MaxAllIdleConns:  100,
            MaxHostIdleConns: 10,
            ResponseHeader:   5 * time.Second,
            TLSHandshake:     5 * time.Second,
        }),
    }))

    client := s3.New(sess)

All of these settings give the client approximately 15 seconds create a connection,
do a TLS handshake, and receive the response headers from the service.
The time that the client takes to read the response body is not covered by these timeouts.
To specify a total timeout for the request to include reading the response body,
use the |sdk-go| client's **WithContext** API operation methods,
such as the |S3| operation
`PutObjectWithContext
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/s3/#S3.PutObjectWithContext>`_
with a **context.Withtimeout**.

The following example uses a timeout context to limit the total time an API request can be active to a maximum of 20 seconds.
The SDK must be able to read the full HTTP response body (Object body) within the timeout or the SDK returns a timeout error.
For API operations that return an **io.ReadCloser** in their response type,
the Context's timeout includes reading the content from the **io.ReadCloser**.

.. code-block:: go

    ctx, cancelFn := context.WithTimeout(context.TODO(), 20 *time.Second)

    resp, err := client.GetObjectWithContext(ctx, &s3.GetObjectInput{
        Bucket: &config.Bucket,
        Key:    &config.Key,
    })
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    //  Read object from resp.Body
