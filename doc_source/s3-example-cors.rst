   :description: Learn to work with cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for an Amazon S3 bucket using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, S3, cross origin resource sharing, CORS


This |sdk-go| example shows you how to list |S3| buckets and configure
CORS and bucket logging. You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <s3>` repository on GitHub.

.. _s3-cors-scenario:

Scenario
========

In this example, a series of Go routines are used to list your |S3| buckets and to configure
CORS and bucket logging. The routines use the |sdk-go| to configure a selected
|S3| bucket using these methods of the |S3| client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetBucketCors <service/s3/#S3.GetBucketCors>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`PutBucketCors <service/s3/#S3.PutBucketCors>`

If you are unfamiliar with using CORS configuration with an |S3| bucket, it's worth your time
to read :s3-dg:`Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) <cors>` in the |S3-dg| before proceeding.

.. _s3-cors-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with using CORS configuration with an |S3| bucket. To learn more, see
  :s3-dg:`Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) <cors>` in the |S3-dg|.

.. _s3-example-cors-config:

Configure CORS on the Bucket
============================

Create a new Go file named :file:`s3_set_cors.go`. You must import the relevant Go and
|sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_cors.go
   :lines: 17-25
   :language: go

This routine configures CORS rules for a bucket by setting the allowed HTTP methods.

It requires the bucket name and can also take a space-separated list of HTTP methods. Using the
Go Language's ``flag`` package, it parses the input and validates the bucket name.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_cors.go
   :lines: 36-45
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Notice the helper method, ``filterMethods``, which ensures the methods passed in are uppercase.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_cors.go
   :lines: 90-101
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials,
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials, and create a new S3 service client.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_cors.go
   :lines: 49-54
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Create a new :sdk-go-api-deep:`CORSRule <service/s3/#CORSRule>` to set up the CORS configuration.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_cors.go
   :lines: 57-64
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Add the ``CORSRule`` to the ``PutBucketCorsInput`` structure, call ``PutBucketCors`` with
that structure, and print a success or error message.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_cors.go
   :lines: 68-82
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4
