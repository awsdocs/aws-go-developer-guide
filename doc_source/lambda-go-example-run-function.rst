########################
Running a |LAM| Function
########################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Run AWS Lambda functions using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, Lambda

The following example runs the |LAM| function :code:`MyGetitemsFunction` in the :code:`us-west-2` region.
This Node.js function returns a list of items from a database. The input JSON looks like the following.

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "SortBy": "name|time",
      "SortOrder": "ascending|descending",
      "Number": 50
   }

Where:

* :code:`SortBy` is the criteria for sorting the results. Our example uses :code:`time`,
  which means the returned items are sorted in the order in which they were added to the database.

* :code:`SortOrder` is the order of sorting. Our example uses :code:`descending`,
  which means the most-recent item is last in the list.

* :code:`Number` is the maximum number of items to retrieve (the default is 50).
  Our example uses :code:`10`, which means get the 10 most-recent items.

The output JSON looks like the following when the function succeeds and two
items are returned.

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "statusCode": 200,
      "body": {
         "result": "success",
         "error": ""
         "data": [
            {
               "item": "item1"
            },
            {
               "item": "item2"
            }
         ]
      }
   }

Where:

* :code:`statusCode` |ndash| An HTTP status code; :code:`200` means the call was successful.
* :code:`body` |ndash| The body of the returned JSON.
* :code:`result` |ndash| The result of the call, either :code:`success` or :code:`failure`.
* :code:`error` |ndash| An error message if :code:`result` is :code:`failure`; otherwise, an empty string.
* :code:`data` |ndash| The returned results if :code:`result` is :code:`success`; otherwise, nil.
* :code:`item` |ndash| An item from the list of results.

The first step is to import the packages we use.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-go-sdk-lambda-example-run-function.go
   :lines: 17-26
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Next create session and |LAM| client we use to invoke the |LAM| function.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-go-sdk-lambda-example-run-function.go
   :lines: 60-64
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Next, create the request and payload, and call :code:`MyGetItemsFunction`.
If there is an error, display a message and quit.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-go-sdk-lambda-example-run-function.go
   :lines: 67-79
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Finally, parse the response, and if successful, print out the items.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-go-sdk-lambda-example-run-function.go
   :lines: 81-108
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

          includes the structures for marshaling the JSON request and unmarshaling the JSON response.
