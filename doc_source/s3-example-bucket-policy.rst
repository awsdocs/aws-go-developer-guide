Working with |S3| Bucket Policies
#################################

.. meta::
   :description: Work with Amazon S3 bucket policies using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go examples, S3, policy, ACL, permissions


This |sdk-go| example shows you how to retrieve, display, and set |S3| bucket polices. You can download
complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <s3>` repository on GitHub.

.. _s3-bucket-policies-scenario:

Scenario
========

In this example, you use a series of Go routines to retrieve or set a bucket policy on an
|S3| bucket. The routines use the |sdk-go| to configure policy for a selected |S3| bucket using
these methods of the |S3| client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetBucketPolicy <service/s3/#S3.GetBucketPolicy>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`PutBucketPolicy <service/s3/#S3.PutBucketPolicy>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteBucketPolicy <service/s3/#S3.DeleteBucketPolicy>`

For more information about bucket policies for |S3| buckets, see
:s3-dg:`Using Bucket Policies and User Policies <using-iam-policies>` in the |S3-dg|.

.. _s3-bucket-policies-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have  :doc:`set up <setting-up>`, and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with |S3| bucket polices. To learn more, see :s3-dg:`Using Bucket Policies and User Policies <using-iam-policies>` in the |S3-dg|.

.. _s3-example-get-policy:

Retrieve and Display a Bucket Policy
====================================

Create a new Go file named :file:`s3_get_bucket_policy.go`. You must import the relevant
Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 17-27
   :language: go

Create the ``exitError`` function to deal with errors.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 79-82
   :language: go
       
This routine prints the policy for a bucket. If the bucket doesn't exist, or there was
an error, an error message is printed instead. It requires the bucket name as input.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 35-40
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials, and create a new S3 service client.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 44-47, 49
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Call :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetBucketPolicy <service/s3/#S3.GetBucketPolicy>` to fetch the
policy, then display any errors.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 52-67
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Use Go's JSON package to print the Policy JSON returned by the call.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 69-76
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

on GitHub.
            
.. _s3-example-set-policy:

Set Bucket Policy
=================

This routine sets the policy for a bucket. If the bucket doesn't exist, or there was
an error, an error message will be printed instead. It requires the bucket name as input. It also requires the same Go and |sdk-go| packages as the previous example, except for the ``bytes`` Go package.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 17-26
   :language: go

Add the main function and parse the arguments to get the bucket name.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 33-38
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load configuration, credentials,
and region information from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials, and create a new S3 service client.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 42-45, 47
   :language: go

Create a policy using the map interface, filling in the bucket as the resource.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 51-66
   :language: go

Use Go's JSON package to marshal the policy into a JSON value so that it can be
sent to S3.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 69
   :language: go

Call the S3 client's :sdk-go-api-deep:`PutBucketPolicy <service/s3/#S3.PutBucketPolicy>`
to PUT the policy for the bucket and print the results.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 75-78, 87-88
   :language: go

The ``exitError`` function is used to deal with printing any errors.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_set_bucket_policy.go
   :lines: 91-94
   :language: go
