Sending and Receiving Messages in |SQS|

   :description: Send or receive a message from an Amazon SQS queue using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go examples, SQS queues

These |sdk-go| examples show you how to:

* Send a message to an |SQS| queue
* Receive and delete a message from an |SQS| queue
* Send and receive messages from an |SQS| queue

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <sqs>` repository on GitHub.

.. _sqs-receive-message-scenario:

The Scenario
============

These examples demonstrate sending, receiving, and deleting messages from an |SQS| queue.

The code uses these methods of the |SQS| client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`SendMessage <service/sqs/#SQS.SendMessage>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ReceiveMessage <service/sqs/#SQS.ReceiveMessage>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteMessage <service/sqs/#SQS.DeleteMessage>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetQueueUrl <service/sqs/#SQS.GetQueueUrl>`

.. _sqs-receive-message-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with the details of |SQS| messages. To learn more, see
  :sqs-dg:`Sending a Message to an Amazon SQS Queue <sqs-send-message>` and
  :sqs-dg:`Receiving and Deleting a Message from an Amazon SQS Queue <sqs-receive-delete-message>`
  in the |SQS-dg|.


.. _sqs-example-send-message:

Send a Message to a Queue
=========================

Create a new Go file named :file:`sqs_sendmessage.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_sendmessage.go
   :lines: 15-23

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_sendmessage.go
   :lines: 27-35

Now you're ready to send your message. In the example, the message input passed to ``SendMessage``
represents information about a fiction best seller for a particular week and defines title,
author, and weeks on the list values.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_sendmessage.go
   :lines: 37-63

.. _sqs-example-receive-delete-message:

Receive and Delete a Message from a Queue
=========================================

Create a new Go file named :file:`sqs_deletemessage.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_deletemessage.go
   :lines: 15-23

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_deletemessage.go
   :lines: 27-32

Now you're ready to receive a message from a queue specified by a queue URL. In the example,
the ``qURL`` variable would hold the URL for the queue containing the message.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_deletemessage.go
   :lines: 35-58

After retrieving the message, delete it from the queue with ``DeleteMessage``, passing the ``ReceiptHandle``
returned from the previous call.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_deletemessage.go
   :lines: 60-71

.. _sqs-example-send-receive-message:

Send and Receive Messages
=========================

Create a new Go file named :file:`sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go`.

You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go
   :lines: 15-26

Get the queue name and timeout passed from the command.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go
   :lines: 32-42

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go
   :lines: 46-51

Get the Queue. You need to convert the queue name into a URL. You can use the ``GetQueueUrl``
API call to retrieve the URL. This is needed for receiving messages from the queue. Print
any errors.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go
   :lines: 56-64

Call ``ReceiveMessage`` to get the latest message from the queue.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go
   :lines: 67-86

The example uses this utility function.

.. literalinclude:: sqs/sqs_longpolling_receive_message.go
   :lines: 88-91
