   :description: Learn to manage IAM account aliases using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, IAM alias


This Go example shows you how to create, list, and delete |IAM| account aliases. You can download complete versions of these example files from the :doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <iam>` repository on GitHub.

.. _iam-aliases-scenario:

Scenario
========

You can use a series of Go routines to manage aliases in |IAM|. The routines use the |sdk-go| IAM client methods that follow:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`CreateAccountAlias <service/iam/#IAM.CreateAccountAlias>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ListAccountAliases <service/iam/#IAM.ListAccountAliases>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteAccountAlias <service/iam/#IAM.DeleteAccountAlias>`

.. _iam-aliases-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with |IAM| account aliases. To learn more, see :iam-ug:`Your AWS Account ID and Its Alias <console_account-alias>` in the |IAM-ug|.


.. _iam-example-create-alias:

Create a New IAM Account Alias
==============================

.. Intro para for this should mention alias, no? Maybe an example of when/why you'd create the new alias? and should first sentence below say "new IAM account alias"?

This code creates a new |IAM| user.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_createaccountalias.go`. You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_createaccountalias.go
   :lines: 15-24

Set up a session and an |IAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_createaccountalias.go
   :lines: 28,31-36

The code takes the new alias as an argument, and then calls ``CreateAccountAlias`` with the alias name.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_createaccountalias.go
   :lines: 38-47

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/go/example_code/iam/iam_createaccountalias.go>`_
on GitHub.


.. _iam-example-list-aliases:


List |IAM| Account Aliases
==========================

This code lists the aliases for your |IAM| account.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_listaccountaliases.go`. You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_listaccountaliases.go
   :lines: 15-23

Set up a session and an |IAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_listaccountaliases.go
   :lines: 27,30-35

The code calls ``ListAccountAliases``, specifying to return a maximum of 10 items.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_listaccountaliases.go
   :lines: 37-52

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/go/example_code/iam/iam_listaccountaliases.go>`_
on GitHub.


.. _iam-example-delete-aliases:


Delete an |IAM| Account Alias
=============================

This code deletes a specified |IAM| account alias.

Create a new Go file with the name :file:`iam_deleteaccountalias.go`. You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_deleteaccountalias.go
   :lines: 15-24

Set up a session and an |IAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_deleteaccountalias.go
   :lines: 28-36

The code calls ``ListAccountAliases``, specifying to return a maximum of 10 items.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_deleteaccountalias.go
   :lines: 38-47

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/go/example_code/iam/iam_deleteaccountalias.go>`_
