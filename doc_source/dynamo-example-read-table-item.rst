###############################
Reading an |DDBlong| Table Item
###############################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Display information about an item in an Amazon DynamoDB tables using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, DynamoDB

The following example uses the |DDB| |nbsp| 
:sdk-go-api-deep:`GetItem <service/dynamodb/#DynamoDB.GetItem>` operation
to retrieve information about the item with the :code:`year` **2015** and
:code:`title`  **The Big New Movie** in the :code:`movies` table in 
your default region.

Create the file *DynamoDBReadItem.go*.
Add the following statements to import the Go and |sdk-go| packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.read_item.imports.txt
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Create the data structure we use to contain the information about the
table item.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.read_item.struct.txt
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load
credentials from the shared credentials file *~/.aws/credentials*
and region from the shared configuration file *~/.aws/config*
and create a new |DDB| service client.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.read_item.session.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Call **GetItem** to get the item from the table.
If we encounter an error, print the error message.
Otherwise, display information about the item.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.read_item.call.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Unmarshall the return value and if the title is not empty,
indicating we got the item,
display the year, title, plot, and rating.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.read_item.unmarshall.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
