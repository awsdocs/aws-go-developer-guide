   :description: Learn to describe alarms in Amazon Cloudwatch using the AWS SDK for Go.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, CloudWatch, alarms

This example shows you how to retrieve basic information that describes your |CW| alarms.

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <cloudwatch>` repository on GitHub.

.. _cw-describe-alarms-scenario:

Scenario
========

An alarm watches a single metric over a time period you specify. The alarm performs one or more actions
based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods.

In this example, Go code is used to describe alarms in |CW|. The code uses the
|sdk-go| to describe alarms by using this method of the ``AWS.CloudWatch`` client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DescribeAlarms <service/cloudwatch/#CloudWatch.DescribeAlarms>`

.. _cw-describe-alarms-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with |CW| alarms. To learn more, see
  :cw-dg:`Creating Amazon CloudWatch Alarms <AlarmThatSendsEmail>` in the |CW-ug|.

Describe Alarms
===============

Choose **Copy** to save the code locally.

Create the file :file:`describe_alarms.go`.
Import the packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch/describe_alarms.go
   :lines: 16-23
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file ~/.aws/credentials,
load your configuration from the shared configuration file ~/.aws/config,
and create a |CW| client.

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch/describe_alarms.go
   :lines: 28-32
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Call :code:`DescribeAlarms`, and print the results.

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch/describe_alarms.go
   :lines: 34, 41-43
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
