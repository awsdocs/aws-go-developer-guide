# Amazon SQS Examples Using the AWS SDK for Go<a name="using-sqs-with-go-sdk"></a>

Amazon Simple Queue Service \(Amazon SQS\) is a fully managed message queuing service that makes it easy to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications\. The AWS SDK for Go examples can integrate Amazon SQS into your applications\. The examples assume you have already set up and configured the SDK \(that is, youâ€™ve imported all required packages and set your credentials and region\)\. For more information, see [Getting Started with the AWS SDK for Go](setting-up.md) and [Configuring the AWS SDK for Go](configuring-sdk.md)\.

You can download complete versions of these example files from the [aws\-doc\-sdk\-examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/go/example_code/sqs) repository on GitHub\.
