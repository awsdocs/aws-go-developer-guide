Getting Metrics from |CW|

   :description: Retrieve a list of published CloudWatch metrics and publish data points
                 to CloudWatch metrics using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, CloudWatch, alarm actions

These Go examples show you how to retrieve a list of published |CW| metrics and publish
data points to |CW| metrics with the |sdk-go|, as follows:

* Listing metrics
* Submitting custom metrics

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <cloudwatch>` repository on GitHub.

.. _cw-get-metrics-scenario:

Scenario
========

Metrics are data about the performance of your systems. You can enable detailed monitoring of
some resources, such as your |EC2| instances, or your own application metrics.

In this example, Go code is used to get metrics from |CW| and to send events to |CWE|.
The code uses the |sdk-go| to get metrics from |CW| by using these methods of the |CW| type:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ListMetrics <service/cloudwatch/#CloudWatch.ListMetrics>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`PutMetricData <service/cloudwatch/#CloudWatch.PutMetricData>`

.. _cw-get-metrics-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have  :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with |CW| metrics. To learn more,
  see :cw-dg:`Using Amazon CloudWatch Metrics <working_with_metrics>` in the |CW-ug|.

.. _cw-example-list-metrics:

List Metrics
============

Choose **Copy** to save the code locally.

Create the file :file:`listing_metrics.go`.

Import the packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch/listing_metrics.go
   :lines: 17-24
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Get the metric name, namespace, and dimension name from the command line.

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch/listing_metrics.go
   :lines: 27-34
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file ~/.aws/credentials,
load your configuration from the shared configuration file ~/.aws/config,
and create a |CW| client.

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch/listing_metrics.go
   :lines: 39-44
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Call :code:`ListMetrics`, supplying the metric name, namespace, and dimension name. Print the metrics returned in the result.

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch/listing_metrics.go
   :lines: 47-55, 61
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/go/cloudwatch/listing_metrics.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _cw-example-custom-metrics:

Submit Custom Metrics
=====================

Choose **Copy** to save the code locally.

Create the file :file:`custom_metrics.go`.

Import the packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch/custom_metrics.go
   :lines: 17-23
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load credentials
from the shared credentials file ~/.aws/credentials,
load your configuration from the shared configuration file ~/.aws/config,
and create a |CW| client.

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch/custom_metrics.go
   :lines: 29-34
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Call :code:`PutMetricData` with the
the custom namespace "Site/Traffic".
The namespace has two custom dimensions: "SiteName" and "PageURL".
"SiteName" has the value "example.com",
the "UniqueVisitors" value 5885 and the "UniqueVisits" value 8628.
"PageURL" has the value "my-page.html",
and a "PageViews" value 18057.

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch/custom_metrics.go
   :lines: 36-73
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

If there are any errors, print them out,
otherwise list some information about the custom metrics.

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch/custom_metrics.go
   :lines: 74-95
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
