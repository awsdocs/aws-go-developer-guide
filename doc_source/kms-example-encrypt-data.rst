        Encrypt data in AWS KMS using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, KMS

The following example uses the |sdk-go|
`Encrypt <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/kms/#KMS.Encrypt>`_ method,
which implements the
`Encrypt <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html>`_ operation,
to encrypt the string "1234567890".
The example displays a readable version of the resulting encrypted blob.
