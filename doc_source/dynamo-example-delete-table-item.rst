Deleting an |DDBlong| Table Item

    :description:
        Delete an Amazon DynamoDB table item using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, DynamoDB

The following example uses the |DDB| |nbsp| 
:sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteItem <service/dynamodb/#DynamoDB.DeleteItem>` operation
to delete the item with the :code:`year` **2015** and
:code:`title`  **The Big New Movie**
from the :code:`Movies` table in your default region.

Create the file *DynamoDBUpdateItem.go*.
Add the following statements to import the Go and |sdk-go| packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.delete_item.imports.txt
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load
credentials from the shared credentials file *~/.aws/credentials*
and region from the shared configuration file *~/.aws/config*
and create a new |DDB| service client.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.delete_item.session.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Call **DeleteItem** to delete the item from the table.
If we encounter an error, print the error message.
Otherwise, display a message that the item was deleted.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.delete_item.call.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
