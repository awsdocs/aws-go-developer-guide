        Delete an |CTlong| trail using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, CloudTrail

This example uses the
:sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteTrail <service/cloudtrail/#CloudTrail.DeleteTrail>` operation
to delete a |CT| trail
in the :code:`us-west-2` region.
It requires one input, the name of the trail.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *delete_trail.go*.
Add the following statements to import the Go and |sdk-go| packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: ./cloudtrail/delete_trail.go
   :lines: 17-25
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Get the name of the trail.
If the trail name is missing,
display an error message and exit.

.. literalinclude:: ./cloudtrail/delete_trail.go
   :lines: 29-38
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Initialize the session that the SDK uses to load credentials
from the shared credentials file
*.aws/credentials* in your home folder
and create the client.

.. literalinclude:: ./cloudtrail/delete_trail.go
   :lines: 41-46
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Call **DeleteTrail** with the trail name.
If an error occurs, print the error and exit.
If no error occurs, print a success message.

.. literalinclude:: ./cloudtrail/delete_trail.go
   :lines: 48-55
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
