Creating |DDBlong| Table Items from a JSON File
###############################################

.. meta::
   :description: Create DynamoDB table items from a JSON file using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, DynamoDB

The following example uses the |DDB| |nbsp| 
:sdk-go-api-deep:`PutItem <service/dynamodb/#DynamoDB.PutItem>` operation
in a loop to create the items defined in *movie_data.json* file in the :code:`Movies` table in 
your default region.

Create the file *DynamoDBLoadItems.go*.
Add the following statements to import the Go and |sdk-go| packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.load_items.imports.txt
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Create the data structure we use to contain the information about the
table item.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.load_items.struct.txt
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Create a function to get the table items from the JSON file.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.load_items.func.txt
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Initialize a session that the SDK will use to load
credentials from the shared credentials file *~/.aws/credentials*
and region from the shared configuration file *~/.aws/config*
and create a new |DDB| service client.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.load_items.session.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Call **getItems** to get the items.
Loop through each item,
marshall that data into a
map of **AttributeValue** objects,
add the item to the :code:`Movies` table,
and print out the title and year of the movie added to the table.

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.go.load_items.call.txt

   :language: go
