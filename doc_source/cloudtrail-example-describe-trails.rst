    :description:
        List the |CTlong| trails using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, CloudTrail

This example uses the
:sdk-go-api-deep:`DescribeTrails <service/cloudtrail/#CloudTrail.DescribeTrails>` operation
to list the names of the |CT| trails
and the bucket in which |CT| stores information
in the :code:`us-west-2` region.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *describe_trails.go*.
Add the following statements to import the Go and AWS SDK for Go packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: ./cloudtrail/describe_trails.go
   :lines: 17-24
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Initialize the session that the SDK uses to load credentials
from the shared credentials file
*.aws/credentials* in your home folder, and create a new service client.

.. literalinclude:: ./cloudtrail/describe_trails.go
   :lines: 29-34
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Call **DescribeTrails**.
If an error occurs, print the error and exit.
If no error occurs, loop through the trails,
printing the name of each trail and the bucket.

.. literalinclude:: ./cloudtrail/describe_trails.go
   :lines: 36-51
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
