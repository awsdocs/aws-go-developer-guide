#################################################################
Encrypting an Amazon S3 Bucket Object on the Server Using AWS KMS
#################################################################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Encrypt Amazon S3 bucket objects on the server with AWS KMS using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples

The following example uses the
:sdk-go-api-deep:`PutObject <service/s3/#S3.PutObject>`
method to add the object :code:`myItem` to the bucket
:code:`myBucket` with server-side encryption set to AWS KMS.

Note that this differs from :doc:`s3-example-default-server-side-encryption`,
is in that case, the objects are encrypted without you having to explicitly perform the operation.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *encrypt_object_on_server.go*.

Add the required packages.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_encrypt_on_server_with_kms.go
   :lines: 17-25
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Get the KMS key from the command line,
where :code:`key` is a KMS key ID as created in the :doc:`kms-example-create-key` example,
and set the bucket and object names.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_encrypt_on_server_with_kms.go
   :lines: 28-35
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Create a session and |S3| client.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_encrypt_on_server_with_kms.go
   :lines: 40-44
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Create input for and call :code:`put_object`.
Notice that the :code:`server_side_encryption` property is set to :code:`aws:kms`,
indicating that |S3| encrypts the object using AWS KMS,
and display a success message to the user.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_encrypt_on_server_with_kms.go
   :lines: 46-54, 61
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
