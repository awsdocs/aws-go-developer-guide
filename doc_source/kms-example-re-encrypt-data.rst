Re-encrypting a Data Blob in |KMSlong|

    :description:
        Re-encrypt data in AWS KMS using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, KMS

The following example uses the |sdk-go|
`ReEncrypt <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/kms/#KMS.ReEncrypt>`_ method,
which implements the
`ReEncrypt <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ReEncrypt.html>`_ operation,
to decrypt encrypted data and then immediately re-encrypt data under a new customer master key (CMK).
The operations are performed entirely on the server side within |KMS|,
so they never expose your plaintext outside of |KMS|.
The example displays a readable version of the resulting re-encrypted blob.
