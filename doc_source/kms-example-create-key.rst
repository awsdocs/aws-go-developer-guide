Creating a CMK in |KMSlong|

    :description:
        Create a CMK data in AWS KMS using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, KMS

The following example uses the |sdk-go| `CreateKey <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/kms/#KMS.CreateKey>`_
method,
which implements the
`CreateKey <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html>`_ operation,
to create a customer master key (CMK).
Since the example only encrypts a small amount of data,
a CMK is fine for our purposes.
For larger amounts of data,
use the CMK to encrypt a data encryption key (DEK).
