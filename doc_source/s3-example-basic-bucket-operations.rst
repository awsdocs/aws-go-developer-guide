   :description: Create and use Amazon S3 buckets using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, S3, list buckets, create bucket,
              list bucket items, add file to bucket, download file from
              bucket, copy bucket item to another bucket, delete bucket
              item, delete all bucket items, restore bucket item,

These |sdk-go| examples show you how to perform the following operations on |S3|
buckets and bucket items:

* List the buckets in your account
* Create a bucket
* List the items in a bucket
* Upload a file to a bucket
* Download a bucket item
* Copy a bucket item to another bucket
* Delete a bucket item
* Delete all the items in a bucket
* Restore a bucket item
* Delete a bucket
* List the users with administrator privileges

You can download complete
versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <s3>` repository on GitHub.

Scenario
========

In these examples, a series of Go routines are used to perform operations
on your |S3| buckets.
The routines use the |sdk-go| to perform |S3| bucket operations using the
following methods of the |S3| client class, unless otherwise noted:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ListBuckets <service/s3/#S3.ListBuckets>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`CreateBucket <service/s3/#S3.CreateBucket>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ListObjects <service/s3/#S3.ListObjects>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`Upload <service/s3/s3manager/#Uploader.Upload>` (from the **s3manager.NewUploader** class)
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`Download <service/s3/s3manager/#Downloader.Download>` (from the **s3manager.NewDownloader** class)
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`CopyObject <service/s3/#S3.CopyObject>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteObject <service/s3/#S3.DeleteObject>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteObjects <service/s3/#S3.DeleteObjects>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`RestoreObject <service/s3/#S3.RestoreObject>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteBucket <service/s3/#S3.DeleteBucket>`

.. _s3-examples-bucket-ops-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with buckets. To learn more, see
  :S3-dg:`Working with Amazon S3 Buckets <UsingBucket>` in the |S3-dg|.

.. _s3-examples-bucket-ops-list-buckets:

List Buckets
============

The
:sdk-go-api-deep:`ListBuckets <service/s3/#S3.ListBuckets>`
function lists the buckets in your account.

   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Call :sdk-go-api-deep:`ListBuckets <service/s3/#S3.ListBuckets>`.
