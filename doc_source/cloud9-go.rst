Using |AC9long| with the |sdk-go|
#################################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Describes how to use AWS Cloud9 with the AWS SDK for Go.

You can use |AC9long| with the |sdk-go| to write and run your Go code using just a browser. |AC9| includes tools such as a
code editor and terminal. Because the |AC9| IDE is cloud based, you can work on your projects from your office, home,
or anywhere using an internet-connected machine. For general information about |AC9|, see the |AC9-ug|.

Follow these instructions to set up |AC9| with the |sdk-go|:

* :ref:`cloud9-go-account`
* :ref:`cloud9-go-environment`
* :ref:`cloud9-go-sdk`
* :ref:`cloud9-go-examples`
* :ref:`cloud9-go-run`

.. _cloud9-go-account:

Step 1: Set up Your AWS Account to Use |AC9|
============================================

Start to use |AC9| by signing in to the |AC9| console as an |IAMlong| (|IAM|) entity (for example, an |IAM| user) in your AWS account who
has access permissions for |AC9|.

To set up an |IAM| entity in your AWS account to access |AC9|, and to sign in to the |AC9| console, see
`Team Setup for AWS Cloud9 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/setup.html>`_ in the |AC9-ug|.

.. _cloud9-go-environment:

Step 2: Set up Your |AC9| Development Environment
=================================================

After you sign in to the |AC9| console, use the console to create an |AC9| development environment.
After you create the environment, |AC9| opens the IDE for that environment.

See `Creating an Environment in AWS Cloud9 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/create-environment.html>`_ in the |AC9-ug| for details.

.. note:: As you create your environment in the console for the first time, we recommend that you choose the option to :guilabel:`Create a new instance for environment (EC2)`.
   This option tells |AC9| to create an environment, launch an |EC2| instance, and then connect the new instance to the new environment. This is the fastest way
   to begin using |AC9|.

.. _cloud9-go-sdk:

Step 3: Set up the |sdk-go|
===========================

After |AC9| opens the IDE for your development environment, use the IDE to set up the |sdk-go| in your environment, as follows.

#. If the terminal isn't already open in the IDE, open it. On the menu bar in the IDE, choose :guilabel:`Window, New Terminal`.
#. Set your GOPATH environment variable. To do this, add the following code
   to the end of your shell profile file (for example, :file:`~/.bashrc` in Amazon Linux, assuming you
   chose the option to :guilabel:`Create a new instance for environment (EC2)`, earlier in this topic), and then save the file.

   .. code-block:: sh

      GOPATH=~/environment/go

      export GOPATH

   After you save the file, source the :file:`~/.bashrc` file to finish setting your GOPATH environment variable. To do this,
   run the following command. (This command assumes you chose the option to :guilabel:`Create a new instance for environment (EC2)`,
   earlier in this topic.)

   .. code-block:: sh

      . ~/.bashrc

#. Run the following command to install the |sdk-go|.

   .. code-block:: sh

      go get -u github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/...

If the IDE can't find Go, run the following commands, one at a time in this order, to install it. (These commands assume you
chose the option to :guilabel:`Create a new instance for environment (EC2)`, earlier in this topic. Also, these commands assume
the latest stable version of Go at the time this topic was written; for more information, see `Downloads <https://golang.org/dl/>`_
on The Go Programming Language website.)

.. code-block:: sh

   wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.9.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz # Download the Go installer.
   sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf ./go1.9.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz              # Install Go.
   rm ./go1.9.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz                                       # Delete the Go installer, as you no longer need it.

After you install Go, add the path to the Go binary to your :code:`PATH` environment variable. To do this, add the following code
to the end of your shell profile file (for example, :file:`~/.bashrc` in Amazon Linux, assuming you
chose the option to :guilabel:`Create a new instance for environment (EC2)`, earlier in this topic), and then save the file.

.. code-block:: sh

    PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

After you save the file, source the :file:`~/.bashrc` file so that the terminal can now find the Go binary you just referenced. To do this,
run the following command. (This command assumes you chose the option to :guilabel:`Create a new instance for environment (EC2)`,
earlier in this topic.)

.. code-block:: sh

   . ~/.bashrc

.. _cloud9-go-examples:

Step 4: Download Example Code
=============================

Use the terminal you opened in the previous step to download example code for the |sdk-go| into the |AC9| development environment.

To do this, run the following command. This command downloads a copy of all of the code examples
used in the official AWS SDK documentation into your environment's root directory.

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples.git

To find code examples for the |sdk-go|, use the :guilabel:`Environment` window to open the
:file:`ENVIRONMENT_NAME/aws-doc-sdk-examples/go` directory,
where :file:`ENVIRONMENT_NAME` is the name of your development environment.

To learn how to work with these and other code examples, see :doc:`common-examples`.

.. _cloud9-go-run:

Step 5: Run Example Code
========================

To run code in your |AC9| development environment, see
`Run Your Code <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/build-run-debug.html#build-run-debug-run>`_ in the |AC9-ug|.
