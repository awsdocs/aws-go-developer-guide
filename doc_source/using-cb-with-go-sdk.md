# AWS CodeBuild Examples Using the AWS SDK for Go<a name="using-cb-with-go-sdk"></a>

CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy\. The AWS SDK for Go examples can integrate AWS CodeBuild into your applications\. The examples assume you have already set up and configured the SDK \(that is, youâ€™ve imported all required packages and set your credentials and region\)\. For more information, see [Getting Started with the AWS SDK for Go](setting-up.md) and [Configuring the AWS SDK for Go](configuring-sdk.md)\.

You can download complete versions of these example files from the [aws\-doc\-sdk\-examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/go/example_code/codebuild) repository on GitHub\.
