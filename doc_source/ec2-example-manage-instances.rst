   :description: Learn to manage Amazon EC2 instances using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, EC2 instance management


These Go examples show you how to:

* Describe |EC2| instances
* Manage |EC2| instance monitoring
* Start and stop |EC2| instances
* Reboot |EC2| instances

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <ec2>` repository on GitHub.

.. _ec2-manage-instances-scenario:

Scenario
========

In these examples, you use a series of Go routines to perform several basic instance management operations.

The routines use the |sdk-go| to perform the operations by using these
methods of the |EC2| client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DescribeInstances <service/ec2/#EC2.DescribeInstances>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`MonitorInstances <service/ec2/#EC2.MonitorInstances>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`UnmonitorInstances <service/ec2/#EC2.UnmonitorInstances>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`StartInstances <service/ec2/#EC2.StartInstances>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`StopInstances <service/ec2/#EC2.StopInstances>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`RebootInstances <service/ec2/#EC2.RebootInstances>`

.. _ec2-manage-instances-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with the lifecycle of |EC2| instances. To learn more,
  see :ec2-ug:`Instance Lifecycle <ec2-instance-lifecycle>` in the |EC2-ug|.

.. _describing-your-instances:

Describe Your Instances
=======================

Create a new Go file named :file:`describing_instances.go`.

The |EC2| service has an operation for describing instances,
:sdk-go-api-deep:`DescribeInstances <service/ec2/#EC2.DescribeInstances>`.

Import the required |sdk-go| packages.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/describing_instances.go
   :lines: 15-22

Use the following code to create a session and |EC2| client.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/describing_instances.go
   :lines: 25-31
   :dedent: 4

Call ``DescribeInstances`` to get detailed information for each instance.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/describing_instances.go
   :lines: 33-39
   :dedent: 4

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/go/ec2/describing_instances.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _ec2-manage-instance-monitoring:

Manage Instance Monitoring
==========================

Create a new Go file named :file:`monitoring_instances.go`.

Import the required |sdk-go| packages.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/monitoring_instances.go
   :lines: 15-25

To access |EC2|, create an EC2 client.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/monitoring_instances.go
   :lines: 30-37

Based on the value of a command-line argument (ON or OFF), call either the ``MonitorInstances``
method of the |EC2| service object to begin detailed monitoring of the specified instances, or  the ``UnmonitorInstances``
method. Before you try to change the monitoring of these instances, use the ``DryRun`` parameter to test
whether you have permission
to change instance monitoring.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/monitoring_instances.go
   :lines: 40, 43-51, 54, 56-63, 65-89

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/go/ec2/monitoring_instances.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _scenario-starting-stopping:

Start and Stop Instances
========================

Create a new Go file named :file:`start_stop_instances.go`.

Import the required |sdk-go| packages.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/start_stop_instances.go
   :lines: 15-25

To access |EC2|, create an EC2 client. The user will pass in a state value of START or STOP and
the instance ID.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/start_stop_instances.go
   :lines: 30-37

Based on the value of a command-line argument (START or STOP), call either the ``StartInstances``
method of the |EC2| service object to start the specified instances, or the ``StopInstances`` method
to stop them. Before you try to start or stop the selected instances, use the ``DryRun`` parameter to
test whether you have permission to start or stop them.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/start_stop_instances.go
   :lines: 40, 43-51, 54-87

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/go/ec2/start_stop_instances.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _ec2-reboot-instances:

Reboot Instances
================

Create a new Go file named :file:`reboot_instances.go`.

Import the required |sdk-go| packages.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/reboot_instances.go
   :lines: 15-25

To access |EC2|, create an EC2 client. The user will pass in a state value of START or STOP and
the instance ID.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/reboot_instances.go
   :lines: 31-36

Based on the value of a command-line argument (START or STOP), call either the ``StartInstances``
method of the |EC2| service object to start the specified instances, or the ``StopInstances`` method
to stop them. Before you try to reboot the selected instances, use the ``DryRun`` parameter
to test whether the instance exists and that you have
permission to reboot it.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/reboot_instances.go
   :lines: 40-48

If the error code is ``DryRunOperation``, it means that you do have the permissions you need to
reboot the instance.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/reboot_instances.go
   :lines: 51,53-63

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/go/ec2/reboot_instances.go>`_
on GitHub.
