Working with |S3| Bucket ACLs
#############################

.. meta::
   :description: Manage Amazon S3 bucket ACLs in using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, S3, ACL, permissions

The following examples use |sdk-go| functions to:

* Get the access control lists (ACLs) on a bucket
* Get the ACLs on a bucket item
* Add a new user to the ACLs on a bucket
* Add a new user to the ACLs on a bucket item

You can download complete
versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <s3>` repository on GitHub.

.. _s3-examples-bucket-acls-scenario:

Scenario
========

In these examples, a series of Go routines are used to manage ACLs
on your |S3| buckets.
The routines use the |sdk-go| to perform |S3| bucket operations using the
following methods of the |S3| client class:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetBucketAcl <service/s3/#S3.GetBucketAcl>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetObjectAcl <service/s3/#S3.GetObjectAcl>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`PutBucketAcl <service/s3/#S3.PutBucketAcl>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`PutObjectAcl <service/s3/#S3.PutObjectAcl>`

.. _s3-examples-bucket-acls-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>`, and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with |S3| bucket ACLs. To learn more, see :s3-dg:`Managing Access with ACLs <S3_ACLs_UsingACLs>` in the |S3-dg|.

.. _s3-examples-bucket-acls-get-bucket-acl:

Get a Bucket ACL
================

The
:sdk-go-api-deep:`GetBucketAcl <service/s3/#S3.GetBucketAcl>`
function gets the ACLs on a bucket.

The following example gets the ACLs on a bucket with the name specified as
a command line argument.

Create the file *s3_get_bucket_acl.go*.
Add the following statements to import the Go and |sdk-go| packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_acl.go
   :lines: 17-23
   :language: go

Create a function to display errors and exit.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_acl.go
   :lines: 69-72
   :language: go

This example requires one input parameter, the name of the bucket.
If the name is not supplied, call the error function and exit.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_acl.go
   :lines: 30-34
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Initialize the session that the SDK uses to load credentials
from the shared credentials file *~/.aws/credentials*,
the region from the shared configuration file *~/.aws/config*,
and create a new |S3| service client.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_acl.go
   :lines: 38-43
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Call :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetBucketAcl <service/s3/#S3.GetBucketAcl>`,
passing in the name of the bucket.
If an error occurs, call ``exitErrorf``.
If no error occurs, loop through the results
and print out the name, type, and permission for the grantees.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_get_bucket_acl.go
   :lines: 46-66
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Set a Bucket ACL
================

The
:sdk-go-api-deep:`PutBucketAcl <service/s3/#S3.PutBucketAcl>`
function sets the ACLs on a bucket.

The following example gives a user access by email address to a bucket
with the bucket name and email address specified as command line arguments.
The user can also supply a permission argument. However,
if it isn'o't supplied, the user is given READ access to the bucket.

Create the file *s3_put_bucket_acl.go*.
Add the following statements to import the Go and |sdk-go| packages used in the example.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_put_bucket_acl.go

   :lines: 101-104
   :language: go

If the optional permission parameter is supplied,
make sure it is one of the allowed values.
If not, print an error message and quit.

   :lines: 55-60
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Get the existing ACLs and append the new user to the list.
If there is an error while retrieving the list,
print an error message and quit.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_put_bucket_acl.go
   :lines: 63-79
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

Build the parameter list for the call based on the existing
ACLs and the new user information.

.. literalinclude:: s3/s3_put_bucket_acl.go
   :lines: 81-90
   :language: go
   :dedent: 4

passing in the parameter list.
If an error occurs, display a message and quit.
Otherwise, display a message indicating success.
