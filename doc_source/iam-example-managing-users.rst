   :description: Learn to manage IAM users with this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, IAM users


This Go example shows you how to create, update, view, and
delete |IAM| users. You can download complete versions of these
example files from the :doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <iam>` repository on GitHub.

.. _iam-users-scenario:

Scenario
========

In this example, you use a series of Go routines to manage users in |IAM|.
The routines use the |sdk-go| IAM client methods that follow:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`CreateUser <service/iam/#IAM.CreateUser>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`ListUsers <service/iam/#IAM.ListUsers>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`UpdateUser <service/iam/#IAM.UpdateUser>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetUser <service/iam/#IAM.GetUser>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`DeleteUser <service/iam/#IAM.DeleteUser>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`GetAccountAuthorizationDetails <service/iam/#IAM.GetAccountAuthorizationDetails>`

.. _iam-users-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>` the |sdk-go|.
* You are familiar with |IAM| users. To learn more, see :iam-ug:`IAM Users <id_users>` in the |IAM-ug|.

.. _iam-example-create-user:

Create a New |IAM| User
=======================

This code creates a new |IAM| user.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_createuser.go`. You must import the relevant Go and
|sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_createuser.go
   :lines: 17-25

The code takes the new user name as an argument, and then calls ``GetUser`` with the user name.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_createuser.go
   :dedent: 4
   :lines: 30-41

If you receive a ``NoSuchEntity`` error, call ``CreateUser`` because the user doesn't exist.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_createuser.go
   :dedent: 4
   :lines: 43-56

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/go/example_code/iam/iam_createuser.go>`_
on GitHub.


.. _iam-example-list-user:


List |IAM| Users in Your Account
================================

You can get a list of the users in your account and print the list to the console.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_listusers.go`. You must import the relevant Go and
|sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_listusers.go
   :lines: 17-23

Set up a new |IAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_listusers.go
   :dedent: 4
   :lines: 28-35

Call ``ListUsers`` and print the results.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_listusers.go
   :dedent: 4
   :lines: 37-51

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/go/example_code/iam/iam_listusers.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _iam_example_update_user:


Update a User's Name
====================

In this example, you change the name of an IAM user to a new value.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_updateuser.go`. You must import the relevant Go and|sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_updateuser.go
   :lines: 17-24

Set up a new IAM client.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_updateuser.go
   :dedent: 4
   :lines: 29-36

Call ``UpdateUser``, passing in the original user name and the new name, and print the results.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_updateuser.go
   :dedent: 4
   :lines: 38-48

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/go/example_code/iam/iam_updateuser.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _iam_example_delete_user:


Delete an IAM User
==================

In this example, you delete an |IAM| user.

Create a new Go file named :file:`iam_deleteuser.go`. You must import the relevant Go and |sdk-go| packages by adding the following lines.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_deleteuser.go
   :lines: 17-25

Set up a new |IAM| client.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_deleteuser.go
   :lines: 32-34, 37

Call ``DeleteUser``, passing in the user name, and print the results. If the user doesn't exist, display an error.

.. literalinclude:: example_code/iam/iam_deleteuser.go
   :lines: 39-52

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/go/example_code/iam/iam_deleteuser.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _iam_example_get_admins:


List the IAM Users who have Administrator Privileges
====================================================

In this example, you list the |IAM| users who have administrator privileges
(a policy or attached policy of the user or a group to which the user belongs
has the name **AdministratorAccess**.

Create a new Go file named :file:`IamGetAdmins.go`.
