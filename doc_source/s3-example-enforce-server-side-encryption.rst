Requiring Encryption on the Server to Upload Amazon S3 Bucket Objects

    :description:
        Require server-side encryption to upload Amazon S3 bucket using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples

The following example uses the
:sdk-go-api-deep:`PutBucketPolicy <service/s3/#S3.PutBucketPolicy>`
method to require that objects uploaded to an |S3| bucket have |S3| encrypt the object with an AWS KMS key.
Attempts to upload an object without specifying that |S3| encrypt the object with an AWS KMS key
raise an :code:`Aws::S3::Errors::AccessDenied` exception.

Avoid using this configuration option if you use default server-side encryption as described in
:doc:`s3-example-default-server-side-encryption` as they could conflict and result in unexpected
results.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *require_server_encryption.go*.

Import the required packages.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_require_server_encryption.go
   :lines: 17-26
   :dedent: 0
   :language: go

Set the name of the bucket, create a session, and create an Amazon S3 client.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_require_server_encryption.go
   :lines: 28,33-37
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Create an |S3| policy that requires server-side KMS encryption on objects
uploaded to the bucket.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_require_server_encryption.go
   :lines: 39-67
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go

Convert the policy into JSON, create the input for and call :code:`PutBucketPolicy`, apply the policy to the bucket,
and print a success message.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_require_server_encryption.go
   :lines: 70, 77-80, 82, 89
   :dedent: 4
   :language: go
