# Amazon S3 Examples Using the AWS SDK for Go<a name="using-s3-with-go-sdk"></a>

Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) is storage for the internet\. The AWS SDK for Go examples can integrate Amazon S3 into your applications\. The examples assume you have already set up and configured the SDK \(that is, youâ€™ve imported all required packages and set your credentials and region\)\. For more information, see [Getting Started with the AWS SDK for Go](setting-up.md) and [Configuring the AWS SDK for Go](configuring-sdk.md)\.

You can download complete versions of these example files from the [aws\-doc\-sdk\-examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/go/example_code/s3) repository on GitHub\.
