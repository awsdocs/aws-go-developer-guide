AWS SDK for Go Developer Guide

   :description: Use the AWS SDK for Go to build Go applications that use AWS services.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go, code examples

Welcome to the |sdk-go|.
The |sdk-go| provides APIs and utilities that developers can use
to build Go applications that use AWS services, such as |EC2long| (|EC2|) and
|S3long| (|S3|).

The SDK removes the complexity of coding directly against a web service
interface. It hides a lot of the lower-level plumbing, such as
authentication, request retries, and error handling.

The SDK also includes helpful utilities. For example, the |S3|
download and upload manager can automatically break up large objects
into multiple parts and transfer them in parallel.

Use the |sdk-go-dg| to help you install, configure, and use the SDK.
The guide provides configuration information, sample code, and an
introduction to the SDK utilities.

Using the AWS SDK for Go with AWS Cloud9
========================================

AWS Cloud9 is a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) that
contains a collection of tools that you use to code, build, run, test, debug,
and release software in the cloud.

See :doc:`cloud9-go` for information on using |AC9long| with the |sdk-go|.
