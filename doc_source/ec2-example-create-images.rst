   :description: Create Amazon EC2 instances with tags or no block devices using this AWS SDK for Go code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go code examples, EC2, tags, block device


This Go example shows you how to:

*  Create an |EC2| instance with tags or set up an instance without a block device

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
:doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <ec2>` repository on GitHub.

.. _ec2-tags-scenario:

Scenarios
=========

In these examples, you use a series of Go routines to create |EC2| instances
with tags or set up an instance without a block device.

The routines use the |sdk-go| to perform these tasks by using these
methods of the :sdk-go-api-deep:`EC2 <service/ec2/#EC2>` type:

* :sdk-go-api-deep:`BlockDeviceMapping <service/ec2/#BlockDeviceMapping>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`RunInstances <service/ec2/#EC2.RunInstances>`
* :sdk-go-api-deep:`CreateTags <service/ec2/#EC2.CreateTags>`

.. _ec2-tags-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

* You have :doc:`set up <setting-up>` and :doc:`configured <configuring-sdk>`
  the |sdk-go|.

.. _create-an-instance-with-tags:

Create an Instance with Tags
============================

The |EC2| service has an operation for creating instances
(:sdk-go-api-deep:`RunInstances <service/ec2/#EC2.RunInstances>`) and another for
attaching tags to instances (:sdk-go-api-deep:`CreateTags <service/ec2/#EC2.CreateTags>`).
To create an instance with tags, call both of these
operations in succession. The following example creates an instance and then
adds a ``Name`` tag to it. The |EC2| console displays the
value of the ``Name`` tag in its list of instances.

.. literalinclude:: ec2/create_instance.go
   :lines: 15-

You can add up to 10 tags to an instance in a
single ``CreateTags`` operation.

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/go/ec2/create_instance.go>`_
on GitHub.

.. _create-image-without-block-device:

Create an Image without a Block Device
======================================

Sometimes when you create an |EC2| image, you might want to explicitly exclude certain block devices. To
do this, you can use the ``NoDevice``
parameter in :sdk-go-api-deep:`BlockDeviceMapping <service/ec2/#BlockDeviceMapping>`.
When this parameter is set to an empty string ``""``, the named device isn't mapped.

The ``NoDevice`` parameter is compatible only with ``DeviceName``, not with any other
field in ``BlockDeviceMapping``. The request
will fail if other parameters are present.
